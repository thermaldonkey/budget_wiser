# Budget Wiser

Ever find yourself short on cash at one particular time of the month, because that's when all your bills are due? Me too. It sucks.
Say goodbye to stressing out every 4th week, and find a way to share the load across all your pay periods equally with Budget Wiser!

## Usage

You're free to get paid as often and as much as you possibly can with this system. Just let the app know how much you're getting paid,
and how long you need to live off of it. Behind the scenes, BW will subtract a share of your monthly deductions from your gross income
and display your specified allowance of the remainder. As you spend money on things other than your recorded deductions, just remember
to sign in and record a withdrawal for the expense, and you'll see your balance decrease and a progress bar of allowance spent increase.
After all, two forms of visual feedback are always better than one, yeah?

### No Stressin', I'm just suggestin'

If you're like me, and budgeting isn't exactly your strong suit, here's the best part: even if you max out your allowance each pay
period, you're still saving money! All those big bills are taking care of themselves! You're free to be as /(ir)?responsible/ as you
can, and rest assured rent is paid.

## Currently In Development

* Demo app coming soon!
* Email notifications (password reset, report at the end of a pay period, etc.)
* Some more aggregate reporting on long-term savings
* Notification system to remind users to set up pay periods when the current one is about to expire
